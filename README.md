# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Developed a Monte Carlo simulation model to analyze the potential performance of a diversified portfolio of 30 randomly selected S&P 500 stocks. Conducted 10,000 simulations to forecast future portfolio values, evaluating key risk metrics including Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). 
Utilized Python for data retrieval, portfolio optimization, and statistical analysis, resulting in a model that highlights risk-return trade-offs and enhances insights into potential financial outcomes.
